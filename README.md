My project report is the document titled Course Project #4...

I've included two cpp programs which I used to obtain all of the data in this experiment
  dictionary_3 is my implementation of the dictionary codec, it was my third revision.
  vanilla is my comparison test which looked at the raw data line by line to get a baseline.

This project took me a while, I'd say close to 15 hours of work over the last week or two.
